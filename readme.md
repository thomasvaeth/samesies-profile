# Profile template
### About
I needed to make templates to add to a store for my final project at General Assembly, [Samesies](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies). This one is a free template for people that want an online business card.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Animate.CSS
* Google Fonts

### How to Make Changes
* Replace the profile picture
  - Crop a picture into a square. Add it the images folder and change line 30 in index.html to direct to your picture.
* Replace and add your links to the social media icons
	- Replace: Download different social media icons [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/neon-line-social-circles) in 48px x 48px, save them in the images folder, and follow the format for the other icons.
  - Add: In index.html just replace the # in <a href="#" with your URL.
* Change card animation
  - Replace flipInY on line 31 in index.html with any animation on [Animate.CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).
* Change fonts
  - [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) has fonts available to use for free. Google does a great job explaining how to add them to your website and you would just have to change the ones that are already in css/main.css.
* Change background linear gradient
  - The linear gradient is in css/main.css on line 30. A great website for gradient colors is [uiGradients](http://uigradients.com/). Just replace the hex values with the ones you want.
* Change background image
  - The background image is in css/main.css on line 19. The easiest way to update it is to add a new picture in the images folder named background.jpg. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has a huge selection of pictures to use.

### Upcoming Additions
* Card flip for more personal information on the back.
