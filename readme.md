# Profile template
### About
I needed to make templates to add to a store for my final project at General Assembly, [Samesies](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies). This one is a free template for people that want an online business card.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts

### How to Make Changes
* Replace the profile picture
  - Crop a picture into a square. Add it the images folder and change line 30 in index.html to direct to your picture.
* Replace and add your links to the social media icons
	- Replace: Download different social media icons [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/neon-line-social-circles) in 48px x 48px, save them in the images folder, and follow the format for the other icons.
  - Add: In index.html just replace the # in <a href="#" with your URL.
* Change fonts
  - [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) has fonts available to use for free. Google does a great job explaining how to add them to your website and you would just have to change the ones that are already in css/main.css.
