# Profile template
### About
I needed to make templates to add to a store for my final project at General Assembly, [Samesies](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies). This one is a free template for people that want an online business card.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Animate.CSS
* Google Fonts

### How to Make Changes
* Replace the profile picture
  - Crop a picture into a square. Add it the images folder and change line 34 in index.html to direct to your picture.
* Replace and add your links to the social media icons
	- Replace: Download different social media icons [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/neon-line-social-circles) in 48px x 48px, save them in the images folder, and follow the format for the other icons.
  - Add: In index.html just replace the # in <a href="#" with your URL.
* Change card animation
  - Replace flipInY on line 32 in index.html with any animation on [Animate.CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).
* Change fonts
  - [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) has fonts available to use for free. Google does a great job explaining how to add them to your website and you would just have to change the ones that are already in css/main.css.
* Change background linear gradient
  - The linear gradient is in css/main.css on line 30. A great website for gradient colors is [uiGradients](http://uigradients.com/). Just replace the hex values with the ones you want.
* Change background image
  - The background image is in css/main.css on line 19. The easiest way to update it is to add a new picture in the images folder named background.jpg. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has a huge selection of pictures to use.
* Change title and favicon
	- The title is in index.html on line 8. 
	- Favicon is the picture that shows up on the tabs next to the title and is in index.html on line 9. There are favicon generator websites where you can drag in a regular picture and it turns it into a favicon. Just save it in images folder and direct it there.

### Upcoming Additions
* Card flip for more personal information on the back.
